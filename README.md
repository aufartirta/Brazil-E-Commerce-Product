# Product Trends & Analysis - Brazil E-commerce
## Project Overview

### Objective:
The project aims to analyze and identify product trends and customer & seller distribution within the Brazilian e-commerce platform Olist. The goal is to derive actionable insights into key performance metrics, such as top-selling product categories, geographical distribution of customers and sellers, order status trends, and overall customer satisfaction.

### Data Sources:
The project utilizes the Brazilian E-commerce Olist dataset, which includes interconnected data on customer orders, products, sellers, geolocation, payments, and reviews.

### Key Metrics:
The analysis focuses on several critical metrics, including customer and seller distribution across cities, product category performance, order status distribution, freight value impact on total order value, and customer review scores.

## Key Findings

1. Geographical Distribution:
* Top Cities by Number of Customers: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, and Curitiba are the cities with the most significant customer bases. These cities represent the primary markets for Olist, offering potential opportunities for targeted marketing and customer engagement strategies.
* Top Cities by Number of Sellers: São Paulo, Curitiba, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, and Ribeirão Preto lead in the number of sellers. This seller concentration in major cities suggests that these areas are strategic hubs for business operations and product distribution.
* Top Cities by Number of Orders and Transactions: São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro, Belo Horizonte, Brasilia, and Curitiba also rank as the top cities with the highest number of orders and transactions. Notably, despite Brasilia having fewer sellers, it remains a significant market due to its large customer base, highlighting an opportunity to attract more sellers to meet demand.
* Transaction Trends Over Time: The number of transactions generally increased over time, with a notable peak in November 2017, likely linked to promotional events such as Black Friday. This suggests a seasonal trend that can be capitalized on for future promotional planning.

2. Product Category Analysis:
* Top-Selling Product Categories: The most popular product categories are bed bath table, health beauty, sports leisure, furniture decor, and computers accessories. These categories dominate sales, indicating strong consumer demand.
* Top-Selling Products by Region: The top-selling products per region were identified and found to correlate with the overall top-selling product categories, reinforcing the demand patterns across different areas.
* Order Status Distribution: Among the 8 different order statuses, the majority of orders are successfully delivered. A smaller percentage of orders are canceled or marked as incomplete, reflecting efficient delivery processes and customer satisfaction.
* Order Success Over Time: Over the years, the trend shows a consistent high percentage of successfully delivered orders, with canceled and incomplete orders being significantly less frequent.
* Freight Value and Total Order Value: Freight value is determined by the product's weight and dimensions and is directly included in the dataset. The total order value is calculated by adding the product price to the freight cost and then multiplying by the quantity of products ordered. High-value product categories include health beauty, watches gifts, bed bath table, sports leisure, and computer accessories. These categories are not only top-selling but also contribute significantly to overall revenue.
* Lowest-Performing Products: The analysis identified the lowest-performing products, which not only have the least sales but also receive the lowest customer scores. These products may require a review to determine if they should be discontinued or improved.

3. Customer Reviews and Seller Performance:
* Customer Satisfaction: A majority (77.07%) of the products sold receive favorable reviews, with scores greater than 4. This indicates overall customer satisfaction with the products.
* Top Reviewed Product Categories: The categories with the highest total review scores are bed bath table, health beauty, sports leisure, furniture decor, and computer accessories. These categories are not only popular but also well-regarded by customers.
* Top Cities by Seller Ratings: Sellers in cities like São Paulo, Ibtinga, Curitiba, Santo André, and São José do Rio Preto receive the highest ratings. These high-rated sellers contribute to maintaining strong customer satisfaction and trust in the platform.

## Conclusions
1. Strategic Focus on Key Cities:
The concentration of customers and sellers in cities like São Paulo and Rio de Janeiro underscores the importance of these regions as primary markets. Strategies to boost seller presence in cities with high customer demand but fewer sellers, such as Brasilia, could drive further growth.
2. Optimization of Popular Product Categories:
The analysis reveals that categories like bed bath table, health beauty, and sports leisure are both top-selling and highly profitable. These categories should be a focal point for inventory management, promotional efforts, and customer engagement initiatives.
3. Enhancing Delivery Efficiency:
While the majority of orders are delivered successfully, continuous monitoring and optimization of delivery processes will help reduce the percentage of canceled or incomplete orders, further improving customer satisfaction.
4. Leveraging Customer Reviews:
With over 77% of products receiving high ratings, there is an opportunity to leverage customer feedback to enhance product offerings, improve marketing strategies, and maintain high customer satisfaction levels.
5. Focus on High-Rated Sellers:
High-rated sellers in key cities contribute significantly to customer trust and satisfaction. Expanding support and resources for these sellers could enhance their performance and, in turn, benefit the overall platform.
6. Review and Improve Low-Performing Products:
Conduct a detailed review of the lowest-performing products to determine whether they should be improved, repositioned, or discontinued, based on their sales and customer feedback.

## Recommendations

1. Targeted Marketing and Seller Recruitment:
Focus marketing efforts and seller recruitment in cities with high customer demand but lower seller presence, such as Brasilia, to capitalize on untapped market potential.
2. Product Category Promotion:
Prioritize promotional activities and inventory investments in the top-selling and highly profitable product categories identified in the analysis to maximize revenue.
3. Continuous Delivery Process Improvement:
Implement measures to further reduce delivery times and decrease the rate of canceled or incomplete orders. Consider partnering with reliable logistics providers and optimizing supply chain management.
4. Utilize Customer Feedback:
Develop a robust feedback loop to continuously gather, analyze, and act on customer reviews, using these insights to refine product offerings, improve customer service, and enhance overall satisfaction.
5. Support High-Rated Sellers:
Provide additional resources and support to high-rated sellers, particularly in key cities, to maintain and improve their performance, thereby ensuring sustained customer satisfaction and platform credibility.
