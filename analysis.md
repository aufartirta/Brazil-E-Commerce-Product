Top-selling product categories are bed bath table, health beauty, sports leisure, furniture decor, and computers accessories.

```sql
--Identify the categories of order status
SELECT DISTINCT order_status FROM orders;
```
Result:
|order_status|
|---|
shipped
unavailable
invoiced
created
approved
processing
delivered
canceled

There are 8 different order statuses based on the final stage of product delivery. The product orders are either delivered, cancelled, or incomplete. Next, we compare the percentage of each category.

```sql
--Compare order statuses trend over the years
SELECT
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS year,
	COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    	COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'delivered' THEN 1 END) AS successful_orders,
	ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'delivered' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS success_percentage,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 END) AS canceled_orders,
	ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS cancel_percentage,
	COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status IN ('shipped', 'processing', 'approved','created', 'invoiced', 'unavailable') THEN 1 END) AS incomplete_orders,
	ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status IN ('shipped', 'processing', 'approved','created', 'invoiced', 'unavailable') THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS incomplete_percentage
FROM orders
GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp)
ORDER BY year;
```
Result:
|year|total_orders|succesful_orders|succesful_percentage|canceled_order|cancel_percentage|incomplete_orders|incomplete_percentage|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
2016|329|267|81.16|26|7.90|36|10.94
2017|45101|43428|96.29|265|0.59|1408|3.12
2018|54011|52783|97.73|334|0.62|894|1.66

Over the years, the majority of orders have been successfully delivered to the customers. The percentage of canceled and incomplete orders is significantly lower than the percentage of successful orders.

```sql
--Identify product volume and compare with product weight and freight value
SELECT
	p.product_id,
	t.product_category_name_english,
	(p.product_length_cm * p.product_height_cm * p.product_width_cm) AS product_volume,
	p.product_weight_g,
	oi.freight_value
FROM products p
JOIN order_items oi
ON p.product_id = oi.product_id
JOIN translations t 
ON p.product_category_name = t.product_category_name;
```
While freight value is calculated based on the product's weight and measurement, in this dataset the freight values are already provided.

```sql
--Identify Total Order Values per Product Category
--formula: (num of product * price) + (num of product * freight price)

SELECT 
    p.product_category_name,
    t.product_category_name_english,
    SUM(oi.price) + SUM(oi.freight_value) AS total_order_value
FROM order_items oi
JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
LEFT JOIN translations t ON p.product_category_name = t.product_category_name
GROUP BY 
    p.product_category_name,
    t.product_category_name_english
ORDER BY 
    total_order_value DESC
LIMIT 10;
```
Result:
|product_category_name|product_category_name_english|total_order_value|
|---|---|---|
