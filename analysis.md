```sql
--Compare order statuses trend over the years
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp) AS year,
    COUNT(*) AS total_orders,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'delivered' THEN 1 END) AS successful_orders,
    ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'delivered' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS success_percentage,
	  COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 END) AS canceled_orders,
    ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status = 'canceled' THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS cancel_percentage,
	  COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status IN ('shipped', 'processing', 'approved','created', 'invoiced', 'unavailable') THEN 1 END) AS incomplete_orders,
	  ROUND((COUNT(CASE WHEN order_status IN ('shipped', 'processing', 'approved','created', 'invoiced', 'unavailable') THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*)), 2) AS incomplete_percentage
FROM
    orders
GROUP BY
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_purchase_timestamp)
ORDER BY
    year;
```
Result:
|year|total_orders|succesful_orders|succesful_percentage|canceled_order|cancel_percentage|incomplete_orders|incomplete_percentage|
